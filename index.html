        <p>I’m Zakaria, a Computer Science major who’s passionate about all tech things and how it shapes the world we live in. I love tackling problems head-on—whether it’s debugging code, figuring out a complex network, or simply finding smarter ways to get things done. For me, problem-solving isn’t just a skill, it’s how I think.</p>
        <p>What excites me most about technology is its power to connect people and create real change. I’m especially drawn to networking and systems that make life easier, faster, and more efficient. Every project I take on is a chance to learn, grow, and build something that matters.</p>
