CSS Basics and  The Box Model

This project is a small, focused assignment to practice the fundamental concepts of CSS, especially the CSS Box Model. It's a great way to build a solid foundation for front-end development by learning how to style and structure web page elements.

About the Project

This project demonstrates how to use an external stylesheet to apply basic styling to a simple HTML page. It visually explains the core components of the CSS Box Model:

  Content: The actual text, images, or other elements.

  Padding: The space between the content and the border.

 Border: The line that surrounds the padding and content.

  Margin: The space outside the border, which separates an element from its neighbors.
